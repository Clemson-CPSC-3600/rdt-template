"""Copy Codex rollout transcripts for this repo into .ai-traces/.

Called from CodexAdapter.ingest (orchestrator-driven). We pull matching
rollouts out of $CODEX_HOME/sessions/, filter by cwd == repo, and copy them
into .ai-traces/codex/raw/rollouts so the adapter can normalize them.

We intentionally do NOT filter by mtime against the pytest session start.
The realistic workflow is: student runs Codex (rollout mtime fixed), then
LATER runs pytest. An mtime >= session_start filter would exclude every
such rollout because the rollout was finalized before pytest started. The
right semantic — "capture all Codex rollouts for this repo that aren't
already fully captured" — is achieved by the cwd match plus the
size-aware idempotency check below (skip only when the destination already
contains every byte the source has). The session_started_at parameter is
kept for API stability but is currently unused.

Why size-aware and not filename-only: Codex CLI 0.119+ (and the desktop
Codex.app) reuse a single rollout file across multiple turns within one
session. A pure ``dest.exists() → skip`` check freezes the captured copy
at whatever size it had on first ingest, so every turn after the first is
silently lost. Comparing dest size to source size lets us re-copy when
the rollout has grown, while still no-oping for genuinely-unchanged
sessions (idempotency on unchanged input is preserved).

Contract: never raises. Returns the list of copied destination paths (possibly
empty). Any error is swallowed and results in an empty list (or a shorter
list of successfully-copied paths), matching capture.py's best-effort error
policy.

Rollout shape (as of Codex CLI 0.119.x, see Task 1 discovery notes):
    Path:    $CODEX_HOME/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<ts>-<uuid>.jsonl
    Line 1:  {"type": "session_meta",
              "payload": {"id": ..., "cwd": "C:\\...", ...}, ...}
Drive-letter casing in payload.cwd varies by producer (``codex exec`` emits
``C:\\`` while the VS Code extension emits ``c:\\``), so both candidate cwd
and target repo are normalized via ``Path.resolve()`` before comparison.
